# Develop-a-Database-to-Analyze-and-Visualize-Hotel-Booking-Data

# Goal
1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
3. What trends can we see in the data?

# Approach
1. We have two hotel types so we segmented revenue by hotel type.
2. We want to understand if there is a trend where number of guests are related with personal cars.
3. Focusd on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
